# SwipeFromLeftWithSnapback
An example implementation of the swipeable cell used in iOS10's Mail.app, where you can swipe fully across to perform the action immediately.

It now also supports swiping from the right as well.

(Swift 3.0)

I hope it's useful to somebody, I'll be using it in v2.0 of [Tacks](http://www.tacks.cc).

Future:

- support device rotation
- allow swiping on the button
