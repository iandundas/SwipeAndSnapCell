I hope it's useful to somebody, I'll be using it in v2.0 of [Tacks](http://www.tacks.cc).


## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

SwipeAndSnapCell is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

## Future:

- allow swiping on the button itself
