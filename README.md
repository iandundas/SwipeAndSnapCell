An example implementation of the swipe-able cell used in iOS10's Mail.app, where you can swipe to reveal a button, or swipe fully across to perform the action immediately. Supports haptic feedback on iPhone 7.

I hope it's useful to somebody, I'll be using it in v2.0 of [Tacks](http://www.tacks.cc).
